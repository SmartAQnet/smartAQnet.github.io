Based on the data from [luftdaten.info](https://luftdaten.info/) and  
motion profiles of mobile phones at radio mast cells, KIT TECO created a fine dust map for Berlin. [Telefonica](https://www.telefonica.de/) officially provided the phone data for the DataRun. TECO also made a [short video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gugd9yc266ojg3p/feinstaub_berlin_1.mp4?dl=0) about the particulate matter model.
(Please note, that this video is not finalized yet).
