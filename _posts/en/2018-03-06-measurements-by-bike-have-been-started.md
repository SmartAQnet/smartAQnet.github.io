On 1st March 2018 the University of Augsburg started the continuous measurements by bike: PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 are measured with an Alphasense OPC-N2 and temperature, humidity and pressure with an Almemo FHAD46-C2 (Ahlborn). Measurements are made at the beginning on four different routes through the city of Augsburg, as well as the surrounding area. The bicycle routes are the routes of employees from home to work. In the near future the network will be extended by additional routes.
