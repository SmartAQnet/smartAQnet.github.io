-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Concluding events of the project „Smart Air Quality Network” (SAQN), 
funded by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure - Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur (BMVI) under grant no. 19F2003B <https://www.smartaq.net>
Patron: Umweltamt der Stadt Augsburg (UA), Schießgrabenstraße 4, 86150 Augsburg
**23 - 24 September 2020**

**Technical basics:** Participation in the workshop including the discussions about the talks and posters, the symposium and the meeting of the Advisory Board will be organised via MS-Teams (E-Mail to [schaefer@atmosphericphysics.de] for access of online participation)and also in the UA in the rooms 203 (laptop), 202 (PC) and foyer (laptop). The number of guests in these rooms is depending from the regulations of the UA. Demonstrations of measurements and applications in front of the UA at the LÜB station Königsplatz are organised for citizen and recorded by a team of the company Grandel Event & Medientechnik (camera, video, sound). A record of the events will be produced and uploaded to the internet page of the concluding events <www.augsburg.de/saqn>.
