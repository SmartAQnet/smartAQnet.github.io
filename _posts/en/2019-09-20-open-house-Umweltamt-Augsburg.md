At the Open House at [Umweltamt Augsburg](https://www.augsburg.de/umwelt-soziales/umwelt/tag-der-offenen-tuer-im-umweltamt/), among other things, a measuring station and the latest results of the UAV flights were presented.
The KIT/ TECO Team showed how easy it is to configure a new low-cost sensor and that the data can be instantly viewed on-line.
Many visitors were very interested to hear about our latest research.
If you would like to build a sensor yourself, you will find more information [here](http://www.smartaq.net/en/participate/).
