After the first scientific scouts (see previous news) were installed in Augsburg, the low-cost sensors have been tested followed in recent weeks. KIT TECO mounted SD011 and DC1700 sensors on the measuring container, which were previously tested at the Leipzig TROPOS institute (see \[https://twitter.com/JanGeorgPlavec/status/897015752468959233/photo/1\]). At present, the sensors - as well as the scientific scouts of the company GRIMM Aerosol Technik - are carrying out initial field measurements, which should eliminate possible problems for the further measuring campaign.
