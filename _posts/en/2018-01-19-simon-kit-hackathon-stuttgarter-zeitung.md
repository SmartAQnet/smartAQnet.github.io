Simon returned with many ideas and interesting questions about big data analysis of low-cost particulate matter sensors. The hackathon was organized as part of the Fine Dust Radar Project (\[https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/feinstaub\]), which will be carried out with the OK Labs in Stuttgart. The project is experimenting with low cost sensors installed by citizens. We hope that in the near future, SmartAQnet can also provide insights into the general usability of such noisy data sources and better data processing capabilities for such projects. We will stay in touch for sure.
