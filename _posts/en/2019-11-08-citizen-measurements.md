Physics teacher [Thomas Hecht](https://www.lifeguide-augsburg.de/magazin/feinstaub-augsburg) created an overview on publicly available sensor data. 
He also examined what the city of Augsburg can do to prevent air pollution und how every citzen of Augsburg can measure particulate matter.
Even though it is not part of project SmartAQnet, it shows that people are now starting to evaluate their obtained data.
