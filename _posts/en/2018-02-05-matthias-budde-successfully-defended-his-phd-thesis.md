Matthias Budde successfully defended his PhD thesis on "Distributed, Low-Cost, Non-Expert Fine Dust Sensing with Smartphones". In his work, he developed systems for detecting fine dust with smartphones (dedicated platforms with low-cost sensors and novel clip-on hardware), algorithms for signal processing and distributed privacy-preserving calibration, as well as insights into the design of the Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) in smartphone-based environmental sensing and Gamification approaches to guide the measurement process.  
The SmartAQnet team congratulates!
