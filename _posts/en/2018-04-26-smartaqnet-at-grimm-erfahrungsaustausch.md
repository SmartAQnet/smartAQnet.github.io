Volker Ziegler (GRIMM Aerosol Technik) used the gathered competence of the conference participants to present the project SmartAQnet. He explained the approaches for an intelligent measurement network to representatives and employees of governmental and non-governmental metering network operators as well as scientists from aerosol and environmental research.  
In addition, Dr. Markus Pesch (also GRIMM Aerosol Technik) reported about the technical approaches and challenges of intelligent, automated measurement sensor technology as well as first experiences with new measuring devices that can be used in an intelligent measuring network of the future.  
  
Together with other partners from the project SmartAQnet (Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen, Aerosol Akademie), the requirements for the structure and construction of such a network were discussed and also the problems with the required validation and quality assurance of Real Time Monitoring and the Inclusion of measured data of different measuring quality.
