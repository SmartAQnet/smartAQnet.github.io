Operational measuring flights by unmanned aerial systems have also been started on 1st March 2018. The measurements are planned for each working day taking place at 7:00 a.m. on the sports grounds of the University of Augsburg. Until the UAVs are equipped with the particulate matter sensor, only the temperature, humidity and wind are measured.
