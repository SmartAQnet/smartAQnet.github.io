The research project smartAQnet
is funded by the **Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure**
(grant number: 19F2003). The ministry is headed by the Federal Minister for
Transport and Digital Infrastructure. He leads and is responsible for the work
of the department and its 63 subordinate authorities. The Minister is supported

The BMVI provides mobility, geo and weather data for its business area via the open data portal **mCLOUD**.
In the future, founders, startups and mobility providers will have a
one-stop-shop for mCLOUD for fast, uncomplicated and free access to data from a
wide range of mobility areas. The mCLOUD is a growing system. It is open to data
from science and industry and is constantly being expanded by the BMVI. For this
purpose, further data sets will be developed, existing digitalised and new data
collected.

The data made available on this website was collected for research purposes as part of the SmartAQnet research project sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) (grant number: 19F2003). Please note that the data was automatically collected by various systems and for the most part not validated, in particular the disclaimer and limitation of liability related to the user license.

In particular, we would like to expressly point out fundamental errors and inaccuracies in the data, since, for example, the sensors used were partly operated by laypersons, were deliberately subjected to outside specifications of the manufacturers or no calibration. Therefore, most of the contained data should not be regarded as "measurements" in the usual sense. Also when importing external measurements or metadata, we do not exclude errors and in case of doubt refer directly to the referenced source (which may be more suitable for further use). In particular, this data collection is not in itself suitable for monitoring or conclusively evaluating the quality of outdoor air at the sites mentioned.
